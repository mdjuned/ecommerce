        <div class="fig1">
            <p> Mobile phones, particularly the smartphones that have become our inseparable companions today, are
                relatively new.

                However, the history of mobile phones goes back to 1908 when a US Patent was issued in Kentucky for a
                wireless
                telephone.

                Mobile phones were invented as early as the 1940s when engineers working at AT&T developed cells for
                mobile phone base
                stations.

                The very first mobile phones were not really mobile phones at all. They were two-way radios that allowed
                people like
                taxi drivers and the emergency services to communicate.

                Instead of relying on base stations with separate cells (and the signal being passed from one cell to
                another), the
                first mobile phone networks involved one very powerful base station covering a much wider area.

                Motorola, on 3 April 1973 were first company to mass produce the the first handheld mobile phone.

                These early mobile phones are often referred to as 0G mobile phones, or Zero Generation mobile phones.
                Most phones today
                rely on 3G or 4G mobile technology.Early cell phones were just for talking. Gradually, features like
                voicemail were added, but the main purpose was talk.
                Eventually, cell phone manufacturers began to realize that they could integrate other technologies into
                their phone and
                expand its features. The earliest smartphones let users access email, and use the phone as a fax
                machine, pager, and
                address book.

                In recent years, the purpose of the cell phone has shifted from a verbal communication tool to a
                multimedia tool, often
                adopting the name “mobile device” rather than being called a phone at all. We now use our cell phones
                more for surfing
                the web, checking email, snapping photos, and updating our social media status than actually placing
                calls.

                “Rapidly expanding software titles, better screen resolution, and constantly improved interface make
                cell phones easier
                to navigate, and more fun to use. Add to that an expanding capacity that can hold as much memory as a
                computer would
                just a few years ago, and you can see why it’s an exploding market,” Grullon says.

                The cell phones of today are also replacing our other gadgets, such as cameras and video cameras. When
                cameras were
                first introduced on phones, the images were low quality and the feature was considered to just be an
                extra.

                “Now, we're seeing a very fast shift to where consumers don't even bother carrying their point-and-shoot
                cameras
                anymore, and just use their cell phones,” says Jamie Lendino, a tech journalist and senior mobile
                analyst for PCMag.com.

                Modern day smartphones — the Apple iPhone in particular — changed everything that consumers expect from
                their phones.
                The app market has transformed the phone into a virtual toolbox with a solution for almost every need.

        <div class="fig1">
            <p>A smartphone is a cellular telephone with an integrated computer and other features not originally
                associated with
                telephones such as an operating system, web browsing, and the ability to run software applications.

                Smartphones can be used by individuals in both a consumer and a business context, and are now almost
                integral to
                everyday modern life.Many consumers use their smartphones to engage with friends, family and brands on
                social media.

                Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn all have mobile apps that a
                user can download
                from their phone's app store. These apps make it possible for smartphone users to post personal updates
                and photos while
                on the go.

                Another common use for smartphones is health and wellness tracking. The Health app for iOS, for
                instance, can keep track
                of sleep behavior, nutrition, body measurements, vital signs, mental health exercises and more.

                Third-party wearable devices, such as smartwatches, can connect with a smartphone to monitor an
                individual's health
                statistics, such as heart rate, and send information to be aggregated on the phone.

                Mobile payment is another widespread use for smartphones. Wallet features allow users to save credit
                card information on
                their phones to use when purchasing items at retail stores. Apps such as Apple Pay also enable users to
                pay other iOS
                users directly from their phones.

                Smartphone use in the enterprise
                BlackBerry devices were the first popular smartphone many organizations offered to their employees for
                business use due
                to BlackBerry's history with strong security. As smartphones added more advanced productivity features,
                security
                techniques and integrations with IT management tools, they began gaining popularity in the enterprise.

                IT professionals in many organizations today support employees that want to use their smartphones for
                work. Businesses
                can adopt enterprise mobility management (EMM) tools to control this use, and can develop a bring your
                own device (BYOD)
                policy to govern what users can do with their devices. Apple and Google have both worked to improve the
                enterprise
                capabilities of their mobile operating systems (OSs), enabling IT to better support iPhone and Android
                devices in
                businesses.

                Because the smartphone form factor is typically smaller than a desktop computer, business users
                typically use it for
                quick tasks, such as sending an email. Tablets and 2-in-1 devices have also joined the mobile device
                market as
                alternatives to both smartphones and PCs for enterprise use.

                Important features
                One of the most important elements of a smartphone is its connection to an app store. An app store is a
                centralized
                portal where users can search for and download software applications to run on their phones. A typical
                app store offers
                thousands of Mobile apps for productivity, gaming, word processing, note-taking, organization, social
                media and more.</p>

                <p>The following are some of the other key features of a smartphone:
            </b></p> <br><br>

            Internet connectivity. <br>
            A mobile browser. <br>
            The ability to sync more than one email account to a device. <br>
            Embedded memory. <br>
            A hardware or software-based QWERTY keyboard. <br>
            Wireless synchronization with other devices, such as laptop or desktop computers. <br>
            The ability to download applications and run them independently. <br>
            Support for third-party applications. <br>
            The ability to run multiple applications simultaneously. <br>
            Touchscreen. <br>
            Wi-Fi. <br>
            A digital camera, typically with video capability. <br>
            Gaming. <br>
            Unified messaging. <br>
            GPS. <br>
            A smartphone also has the ability to support accessories, including Bluetooth headphones, power charging
            cables and
            extra speakers. Because of the fragile outer casing of most smartphones, users often also purchase
            screen protectors and
            more durable cases to put their phones in.

            Because they run an OS and applications, smartphones get consistent software updates. Vendors update
            their mobile OSs a
            few times a year. Individual mobile apps in an app store also get constant software updates that users
            can either choose
            to install or ignore.</p>

            <p><b>Followings are the disadvantages of smartphone:</b><br> <br>
                The electromagnetic radiation will be high because of the heavy internet usage and might lead to health
                problems such as
                a brain tumor and Skin Cancer. <br>

                The HEV light emitted from the screen of a smartphone leads to severe eye-strain during long-time use
                and would slowly
                damage the retina. <br>
                Even many psychological issues such as loneliness, being suspicious all the time, feeling self-centered
                etc. are caused
                by using a smartphone and being online, for most of the time. <br>

                Spending most of the time on your phone creates neck problems and sleep deprivation. <br>

                Exposure to unwanted things on the internet affects a child’s growth mentally and even physically. <br>
                <br> <br>
                However, there are two sides of a coin. No harm can be caused by anything if you do not get indulged
                into it blindly.
                Wiseness lies where you take the positive and helpful aspects of anything and leave the negative and
                unnecessary
                attachment to that. One should be careful and should not get involved completely into something. Hence,
                being aware of
                the pros and cons and having self-control could save you from many disasters, which is really necessary.

                The artificial intelligence of the future could make more complex and human-like decisions. It could be
                the hub of a
                suite of smart devices such as entertainment, connected cars or home automation, able to make restaurant

                Smartphones in 2030 could have holographic display technologies which could render 3D images or videos
                that would float
                above the device and be viewed from any angle without the need to wear 3D glasses.</p>
