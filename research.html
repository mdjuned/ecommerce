                <p>This is the research1 that i have carried out while developing this website. The figure on the left
                    side is taken as reference and similar template is developed using html,css and javascript. The main
                    objective of this research is to develop a website which sells mobile phones. In this research the
                    first picture is linked with the actual website from which the reference is taken. The color theme
                    and the navbar is copied and shown in the second picture. Although many of the contents are changed
                    but when we see both pictures we get same vibes as they are same and copied exactly. The website
                    Sellcell has given me a rough idea to develop my website E-container.</p>

                <p> This is Research number two that i have carried out while developing this website. In this research
                    i have tried to copy the accordion and the button too. The accordion shows different aspect of my
                    website that why customers should use this site to buy any mobile related products. When we see the
                    picture on the left and compare it to the picture that i have made in my website we can see many
                    similar things. I can proudly say that the research was a success and was accoriding to the plan.
                    The picture on left is also clickable and it takes to the site from which the reference was taken.
                    And yes this is also the internal javascript example that i have used to make this accordion.

                <p>This is Research number 3 that i have carried out while developing this website. It shows the box
                    list that are placed perfectly and same was done in my website too. Although the slider was not made
                    i have tried to justify it to the full extent. The picture on my left also takes to the site from
                    where the reference was taken. Some of the key features such as hover and javascript were
                    implemented while trying to copy this template.The key features section was justified well and
                    copied. The reference picture is also clickable and it takes to the website from which the reference
                    was taken.

                <p>The research 4 includes the footer section that was made. The idea was taken roughly and implemented
                    to make the footer section. One thing that really caught my eye was the Payament section and use of
                    logo of visa card and all. Moreover, the icon of facebook and other were extracted from the library
                    of font awoesome so that i could make as exact as the reference picture. Although the color are
                    different than the reference template it matches somehow with the other one. As same as other, this
                    picture is also clickable and is linked with the site from which i have taken the reference. I have
                    also Inspected the code for the font family and the color.</p>

                <p>This research shows the template of how the blog was written. As like the picture on the left the
                    main div section is all justified to the center and i have done same too.Writing blogs was made
                    whole easy with the help of this research. The research gave me the rough idea of how the blog is
                    written. Same like all four researches above this is also linked with the website from which the
                    reference was taken and is justified too in my opinion. I also tried to point out peculier nature so
                    that it would be easy to spot. </p>
